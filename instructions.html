	<p>The homepage for this site allows you to view the videos that have been uploaded in a table going down the page. If you would like to search for a specific video, enter your search terms in the top bar of the page and click the search button.</p>
	<h4 style = "text-align: center;"> Uploading Files</h4>

(Note that this is currently non-functional, as pausch does not support the file upload portion. This issue has been noted by Dr. Xaio and he is working to resolve it.)</p>
