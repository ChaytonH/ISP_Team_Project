	<h4 style = "text-align: center;"> Architecture</h4>

	<p> The architecture was designed to be generally easy to navigate. The homepage can access file uploading, searching, help and this documentation. The homepage is accessable from any other page along with the help section and the search is avalible the same way. This prevents the user from being bottlenecked into any part of the site, making sure that they can always return to the starting point for the site.</p>

	<h4 style = "text-align: center;"> Business Logic</h4>
	<p> Initially, the database is fully displayed to the homepage using a while function to show the videos and their names and descriptions. When a user searches, the files that have the string searched for are displayed in a similar manner to the homescreen. When uploading a file, the filename and description are added to the database while the file is uploaded to a pausch directory. (Note: due to the way that pausch works, file uploading is currently non functional. Dr. Xaio said he is working on the issue currently.</p>

	<h4 style = "text-align: center;"> Database Design</h4>

	<p> The database only holds the filename and the description of the file added by the user. This is added to through the file upload screen.</p>
